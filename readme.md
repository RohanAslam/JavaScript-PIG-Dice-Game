## :loudspeaker: Introduction

The **PIG Dice Game** is a simple yet engaging web application that allows two players to compete against each other in a race to reach a predetermined score. With a combination of luck and strategy, players take turns rolling a die and accumulating points, but they must decide when to hold their points and pass the turn to the opponent.

## :scroll: Rules

1. The game is played by two players, taking turns.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score.
3. If the player rolls a 1, their round score is lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.
4. The player can choose to "Hold," which means their round score gets added to their total score. After that, it's the other player's turn.
5. The first player to reach or exceed the predetermined winning score (default: 100) wins the game.
